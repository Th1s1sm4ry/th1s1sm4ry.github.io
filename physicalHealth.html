                            Physical health is a crucial aspect of overall well-being. It encompasses various factors including nutrition, exercise, sleep, and mental health. By focusing on these areas, you can improve your physical health and enhance your quality of life.

                        I did not write that. but VS Code suggests me a lot of things written by AI and i wanted to record it to have data on what AI suggests to me.

                        Why I made physical important as one of the aspects. <br> Of the 5 i have (4 of the others being Emotional, Mental, Social and Spiritual), physical health is the physical aspect in our lives. It is important to be wary of our physicaal self as this is the gateway to the external world. It is how we connect to the things we perceive through the 5 senses we've learnt as a child (sight, hearing, touch, taste and smell).  <br>
                        <strong>Sight</strong> This has always been the most prominent sense we rely on. <br>
                        <strong>Hearing</strong> From interactions Ive made, I find this to be the second most important sense. <br>
                        <strong>Touch</strong> This detects disgust prominently. At least for me. Through touch we can feel whether something is nice or not. <br>
                        <strong>Smell</strong> This is also another perception for disgust. <br>
                        <em>Man, all this disgust makes me think , am I naturally disgusted? </em>
